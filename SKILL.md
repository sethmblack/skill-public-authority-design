# Public Authority Design

Understand and analyze how self-funding entities are structured to generate independent revenue, issue debt, and operate outside normal democratic oversight. Based on Robert Moses's use of public authorities as permanent power bases.

---

## When to Use

- Analyzing how quasi-governmental entities work
- Understanding revenue-backed bond structures
- Examining entities that seem immune to political control
- Designing (or critiquing) independent agencies
- Investigating why some public bodies can't be reformed

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How does this authority work?"
- "Why can't the mayor/governor control this?"
- "How do they fund themselves?"
- "What makes this entity independent?"
- "How was this designed to avoid oversight?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| entity | Yes | The authority or agency to analyze |
| jurisdiction | No | State, municipal, or federal context |
| purpose | No | Why entity was created |
| revenue_sources | No | How it funds operations |

---

## Core Principle

> "The public authority is the key to power: it issues bonds without voter approval, generates revenue from tolls and fees, exists outside normal government oversight, and cannot be easily dissolved once created."
> — Robert Moses methodology

**The Insight:** Public authorities occupy a unique space—public purpose with private-sector operational freedom. Understanding their design reveals why they're powerful and how they resist control.

## Anatomy of a Public Authority

### Legal Foundation

Authorities are created by:
- State legislation (most common)
- Municipal charter
- Interstate compact
- Federal statute

The enabling legislation defines:
- Purpose and powers
- Governance structure
- Revenue authority
- Oversight mechanisms (or lack thereof)

### Revenue Model

The key to independence is self-generated revenue:

| Revenue Type | Example | Control Level |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| Tolls | Bridge, highway, tunnel | High independence |
| User fees | Airport, port, utility | High independence |
| Rents | Development authorities | Medium independence |
| Tax allocation | TIF districts | Medium independence |
| Appropriations | Traditional agency | Low independence |

**Moses's insight:** Control the tolls, control the authority. Revenue that doesn't require annual appropriation can't be cut by politicians.

### Bond Covenants

When authorities issue bonds, they enter contracts with bondholders:

**Covenant provisions may include:**
- Toll/fee maintenance requirements
- Reserve fund mandates
- Debt coverage ratios
- Restrictions on using surplus
- Limits on government interference

**The constitutional shield:** Under Article I, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution, states cannot impair contract obligations. Bond covenants are contracts. Once sold, even the legislature that created the authority cannot unilaterally change terms.

### Governance Insulation

How authority boards resist political control:

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Staggered terms | No single election changes majority |
| Fixed terms | Removal requires cause, not will |
| Ex officio members | Positions tied to other offices |
| Self-perpetuating boards | Board appoints own members |
| Bi-partisan requirements | Neither party fully controls |

### Perpetuity Mechanisms

How authorities persist indefinitely:

1. **Rolling bonds:** Issue new bonds before old mature
2. **Expanded mission:** Amend enabling law to add purposes
3. **Asset accumulation:** Build reserves that justify continued existence
4. **Indispensability:** Become essential to government operations

---

## Workflow: Analyzing an Authority

### Step 1: Find the Enabling Legislation

- What law created this entity?
- What powers were granted?
- What limitations exist?
- Has it been amended?

### Step 2: Map the Revenue

- Where does money come from?
- Is it self-generated or appropriated?
- Are there reserves or surpluses?
- Who controls pricing (tolls, fees)?

### Step 3: Examine the Bonds

- Has the authority issued debt?
- What do bond covenants require?
- When do bonds mature?
- What can't be changed while bonds are outstanding?

### Step 4: Analyze Governance

- Who appoints the board?
- How long are terms?
- How are vacancies filled?
- Who can remove members?

### Step 5: Identify Vulnerabilities

- What could a determined executive do?
- What would require legislative action?
- What's protected by bond covenants?
- What external changes could disrupt?

## The Moses Model (Maximum Independence)

Moses designed his authorities for maximum power:

1. **Toll-backed revenue:** No dependence on appropriations
2. **Perpetual bonds:** Roll over every 39 years
3. **Covenant protection:** Powers written into bond contracts
4. **Staggered terms:** No single governor could replace board
5. **Surplus accumulation:** Built reserves for new projects
6. **Mission expansion:** Added "connecting" roads to bridge authority

**The result:** 44 years of power across 6 governors and 5 mayors.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Legal structure | How the authority was created |
| Revenue analysis | Sources and independence of funding |
| Covenant summary | Bond restrictions on government action |
| Governance map | How board is appointed and controlled |
| Vulnerability assessment | What could change this entity |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**User:** "The Port Authority of NY & NJ seems to do whatever it wants. The governors complain but nothing changes. How does it work?"

**Public Authority Design response:**

The Port Authority is a masterclass in authority design for independence:

**Legal Foundation:**
- Created by interstate compact (1921) between NY and NJ
- Compact approved by Congress (required for interstate agreements)
- Cannot be amended without both states AND Congress agreeing
- Federal courts have jurisdiction over disputes

**Revenue Model:**
- Tolls from bridges and tunnels
- Airport fees (JFK, LaGuardia, Newark)
- Port terminal rents
- PATH train fares
- World Trade Center rents
- **Total: billions annually, no appropriations needed**

**Bond Covenants:**
- Extensive reserves required
- Toll maintenance covenants
- Cross-subsidization between facilities
- Bondholders have standing to sue if covenants violated

**Governance:**
- 12 commissioners: 6 from each state
- Appointed by governors, confirmed by senates
- Staggered 6-year terms
- Either governor can veto actions (rarely used, creates gridlock)

**Why governors can't control it:**
1. **Interstate compact:** Neither state can unilaterally change it
2. **Bond covenants:** Bondholders can sue to prevent interference
3. **Staggered terms:** Takes years to replace majority
4. **Revenue independence:** Can't starve it of funds
5. **Essential services:** Can't shut it down without chaos

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Both governors agreeing (rare)
- Congressional action (extremely rare)
- Scandal forcing federal investigation
- Bond default (never happened)

**The governors' real options:**
- Veto specific actions (creates conflict)
- Nominate friendly commissioners (slow, partial)
- Public criticism (embarrassing but ineffective)
- Federal pressure (requires major crisis)

The Port Authority was designed to be independent. It is.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **power-accumulation-analysis** - Authorities as power bases
- **fait-accompli-strategy** - Using authority independence for speed
- **infrastructure-as-power** - Physical assets controlled by authorities

---

## Ethical Note

Public authorities can serve legitimate purposes—insulating infrastructure investment from political cycles, enabling long-term planning, maintaining professional management. But they can also become unaccountable power centers.

This skill is for **understanding** how authorities work, whether for:
- Citizen oversight
- Journalistic investigation
- Reform design
- Academic analysis
- Legitimate entity creation

Moses showed both the power and the danger of independent authorities.
